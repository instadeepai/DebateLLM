                pregnancy test is performed which confirms she is pregnant. She has mild bipolar disorder for which she takes lithium and
                admits that she has been taking it ‘on and off’ for 2 years now but has never had any symptoms or episodes of relapse. She
                says that she had not made contact with her psychiatrist for the past several months because she ‘couldn’t find any time.’
                Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?\n
                (A) Taper lithium and administer valproate\n
                (B) Continue lithium administration through pregnancy and add lamotrigine\n

                conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on
                morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and
                heart failure. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50
                mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until
                1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for
                heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia. Results: During a mean follow-up of 16 months,
                there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence
                interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to
                cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary
                endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by eplerenone (relative
                risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or
                any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in
                the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The
                rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas
                the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Which of

                was administered every 8 h. CVVHDF was targeted as a 2-3 L/h exchange using a polyacrylonitrile filter with a surface area
                of 1.05 m2 and a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min. Serial blood (pre- and post-filter), filtrate/dialysate and ISF concentrations
                were measured on 2 days of treatment (Profiles A and B). Subcutaneous tissue ISF concentrations were determined using
                microdialysis. A total of 384 samples were collected. During Profile A, the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak
                concentrations were 13.6 (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L and the trough concentrations were 2.6 (2.4-3.4) and 4.9
                (3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively. During Profile B, the ISF trough concentrations increased by ∼40%. Meropenem ISF penetration
                was estimated at 63% (60%-69%) and 69% (65%-74%) for Profiles A and B, respectively, using comparative plasma and
                ISF AUCs. For Profile A, the plasma elimination t1/2 was 3.7 (3.3-4.0) h, the volume of distribution was 0.35 (0.25-0.46)

                \n\nContext: Family caregivers of dementia patients are at increased risk of developing depression or anxiety. A multi-component
                program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in
                caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet
                been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling
                dementia patients. A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling
                dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants
                were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n=96) or usual care (n=96) condition. The intervention consisted of
                two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures
                after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms
                (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol
                analyses were performed. A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12
                months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98;
                95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient=-1.40; 95% CI -3.91 to 1.10)
                or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = -0.55; 95% CI -1.59 to 0.49). The intervention did

                clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred
                for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153
                of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up–telephone call, letter, or certified

                adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to
                follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to
                follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were
