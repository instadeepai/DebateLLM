                prolactin levels. Atypicals such as olanzapine and aripiprazole cause small if no elevation. Risperidone is known to result in a
                sustained elevated prolactin level. Therefore risperidone is likely to cause the maximum increase in prolactin level.

            - "\n\nExplanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The age of routine screening depends
                on the country you are interested in and varies widely. For the US, it is 40 years of age according to the American Cancer
                Society. In Europe, it is typically closer to 50 years. For a patient based in the US, the best answer is 40 years.

                invertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. The soft, gelatinous 'nucleus pulposus' is forced out
                through a weakened part of the disk, resulting in back pain and nerve root irritation. In this case, the impingement is resulting
                in paralysis, and should be considered a medical emergency. Overall, the structure that is causing the compression and
                symptoms is the nucleus pulposus.

                known as Kultschitsky-type cells, Feyrter cells and APUD cells, are found in the basal layer of the surface epithelium and in
                the bronchial glands.

            - "\n\nExplanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Because Clostridium perfringens
                spores are both specific to sewage contamination and environmentally stable, they are considered as possible conservative
                indicators of human fecal contamination and possible surrogates for environmentally stable pathogens.
